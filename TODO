Popup Post
- [x] Arrows: hover effect 
    - [x] Make these look like little circles on the side of the popup 
- [ ] Preload images
- [x] Popup doesn’t work on mobile
    - [x] try adding data-tap-disabled="true" on your map div
- [x] Pop up doesn’t move to next point on click of new marker (annoying)
- [ ] Buttons
    - [ ] [LIKE | DISLIKE | COMMENT | SHARE <| DELETE> ]
    - [x] Share
        - [ ] Front end popup dialogue with social media links (maybe there’s a good tool for this)
        - [ ] Backend
            - [ ] Save a static map screenshot as image url for social media (this should be done on creation)

Overall Appearance
- [ ] Prevent page zoom (outside map)git 
- [ ] Theme on mapbox (see map visual below)
- [ ] Overall UI consistency 

Map Visual
- No street border just names on white, same for highways
- Parks in deep green
- Natural area in light green
- Trails in orange 
- Oceans river lakes in light blue
- Landmarks in purple?

Map
1. Angular mapController 
    - Shares to/from global state
    - Takes user input
2. JS class Map
    - Middleman than holds extraneous map data
    - Controls mapbox 
3. Mapbox map
    - Does what the map class says

Overall Frontend
- [ ] Convert to imported modules
- [ ] move more of the scope variables into similar objects
- [ ] Main factory should have one big return object rather than the weird list it currently is

Overall Backend
- [ ] upload images to s3: http://zabana.me/notes/upload-files-amazon-s3-flask.html
- [x] Login 
    - [x] needs more data checks 
    - [x] Facebook (switch to flask plugin?)
    - [ ] Email (ugh) 
- [ ] Force logout on error / new version update
- [ ] Helpers
    - [ ] File uploader
        - [ ] By url
        - [ ] By JS?
    - [ ] session variable and builds the index page’s default **options

Overall Workflow
- [ ] Tools folder
    - [ ] S3 loader [make upload]
        - [ ] bundle.js
        - [ ] bundle.css 

Mobile
- [ ] pop up size and position
- [ ] Pop up content
- [ ] Marker click
- [ ] Page zoom
- [ ] Can’t even move map on mobile 
- [ ] If the page is really thin, bring the point to the center bottom


You can run this.functionName().then(function(){})
As long as this.functionName returns Promise.resolve()
